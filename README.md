# PageRank Algorithm using Markov Decision Process

## Overview

This repository contains an implementation of the Google PageRank algorithm using a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The PageRank algorithm is used to rank web pages in search engine results by calculating the probability of a user randomly clicking on links reaching a particular page. By modeling this as an MDP, we can leverage the theory and tools from reinforcement learning and stochastic processes to enhance and analyze the PageRank.
